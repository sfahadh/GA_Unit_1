    <h3>Quick Synopsis of Myself</h3>
    <p>Hello, as you can see from the big header, my name is Fahad Hussain and I am the designer for this website. I am a student at General Assembly enrolled in the Software Engineer Immersive program. I am there to take my programming skills to the next level so I can work as a full-time employee and further improve my skills (also to make some bread).</p>
