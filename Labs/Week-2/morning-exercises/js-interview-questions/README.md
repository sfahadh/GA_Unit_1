## Interview Questions

1. Write a function called factorial() that takes a number and multiplies up all numbers from 1 through that number. Example: factorial(5) should equal 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5.

   ```js
   const factorial = (num) => {
    // code in here
   }
   ```

2. Write a function called fibonacci() that takes a number n and returns the fibonacci sequence as an array up to the nth element. For example, fibonacci(5) should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].
   
   ```js
   const fibonacci = (n) => {
    let sequence = [0, 1];
    // code in here
   }
   ```

3. Write a function called isPrime() that returns a boolean depending on whether or not a given number is a prime number or not. For example, isPrime(5) should return true, whereas isPrime(4) should return false.
   
   ```js
   const isPrime = (n) => {
    // code in here
   }
   ```

4. Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that's the same when read forward and backward; for example: civic, mom, racecar, kayak

   ```js
   const isPalindrome = (str) => {
    // code in here
   }
   isPalindrome("civic") // true
   isPalindrome("civil") // false
   ```

5. Write a function that takes an array of characters and reverses the letters in-place. An in-place algorithm operates directly on its input and changes it, instead of creating and returning a new object.

   ```js
   const reverseArrayInPlace = (arr) => {
    // code in here
   }
   ```

6. Write a function `isMagic` that takes in a matrix, represented as an array of arrays of length N and returns true if the matrix is a magic square and false otherwise.

   ```js
    var isMagic = function(mat) {
      // code goes here
    };
   ```
