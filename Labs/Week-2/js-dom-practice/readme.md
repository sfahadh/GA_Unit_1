# JS DOM Practice

Practice getting elements from the DOM using the common methods for interacting with the DOM!

For each of these you should store the result in a variable and `console.log` it see if you got it right.

example:
```js
let something = document.getElementById('randomID')
console.log(something)

// => <h1 id="randomID">something</h1>
```

## `getElement(s)By`

The first set of DOM getters we'll talk about are the `getElement(s)By` methods, like `getElementById`. Open up `getelements.js` and work through the prompts.

## `querySelector`

The second set of DOM getters we'll talk about are `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`. Comment out `getelements.js` in `index.html` and uncomment `queryselector.js`. Then open up `queryselector.js` and work through the prompts.
